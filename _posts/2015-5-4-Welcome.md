I am now working at [Dept. of Industrial & Manegement Engineering](heep://ime.hufs.ac.kr), [Hankuk University of Foreign Studies](http://www.hufs.ac.kr) as an assistant professor. 

My main research interest is to analyse, model, design, and implement algorithms for optimization problems by using in-depth theory and the state-of-the-art tools. 

You can download my [CV](/cv.pdf).

## Some facts about me:

- My Erdös number is **3** (Paul Erdös -> Gutti Jogesh Babu -> Dennis K. J. Lin -> Me!). You can calculate your own at [here](http://www.oakland.edu/enp/). I bet it will be much smaller than you may think!

  - McDermott, James P.; **Babu, G. Jogesh**; Liechty, John C.; **Lin, Dennis K. J.** Data skeletons: simultaneous estimation of multiple quantiles for massive streaming datasets with applications to density estimation. *Stat. Comput.* 17 (2007), no. 4, 311–321.

- I am very enjoying collaborations with researchers from other fields. If any optimization issues come up in your research, you may contact me!
